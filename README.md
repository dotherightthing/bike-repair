## Disc Brakes

### [Global Mountain Bike Network - How To Clean Your Disc Brakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXQxLK6z5WA)

1. Wear [Nitrile safety gloves](https://www.worksafety.co.nz/gloves/nitrile/621010), to protect your skin from the solvents and prevent oil transfer from your hands
2. Remove rotor and pads
3. Using disc brake cleaner (e.g. [WD-40 Specialist Motorbike Brake Cleaner](https://wd40.co.uk/product/motorbike-brake-cleaner/)) or [Isopropyl Alcohol](https://www.bunnings.co.nz/sparko-1l-isopropyl-alcohol_p0175315) and lint-free shop towels, clean both (to remove oils from leaky brakes, water displacers, spray lubricants and from your own hands) then set aside so the cleaner can evaporate
4. Using emery paper (which [looks and feels like sandpaper but is used on metal rather than wood](https://www.infobloom.com/what-is-emery-paper.htm)) wrapped around a block, scrub to clean pads, then repeat with the rotors to remove pad residue (including that remaining from the bedding-in process) and roughen up the surface so that the new pads can bite - the rotor surace should feel rough and appear matte rather than shiny
5. Clean again
6. [Bed-in the pads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vauPWZT9L6c) by dowsing water over the calipers and pads, riding fast on the flat, then braking hard. Repeating this several times deposits an even layer of pad residue across the rotor to ensure that braking does not cause the pads to vibrate (which can cause audible squealing or howling, or be felt with your hands). Don't drag the brakes riding downhill as the resultant heat build-up can glaze the pads over, which will require the glaze to be filed off before they can be used.
